ADMIN PANEL SECURITY SYSTEM

This admin directory implements a security-by-obscurity system with a dummy login panel.

HOW IT WORKS:
- The main login.php redirects to a dummy auth.php page
- The dummy page looks like a real admin login but doesn't authenticate
- All login attempts are logged for security monitoring
- Real administrators can access the actual login page through a hidden method

ACCESSING THE REAL ADMIN PANEL:
To access the real admin login page, visit:
http://yoursite.com/admin/auth.php?access=admin_panel

Then click "Register here" to create an admin account or use an existing one.

SECURITY NOTES:
- This system helps protect against automated attacks by misleading bots
- All access attempts to the dummy panel are logged
- The real admin login page is hidden from casual visitors
- Additional authentication methods should still be used for production environments

For more security, consider:
1. Changing the access parameter value
2. Implementing IP whitelisting
3. Adding two-factor authentication
4. Using strong passwords
